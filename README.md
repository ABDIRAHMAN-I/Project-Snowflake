# Project Snowflake: Deploying Snowflake Using LocalStack

## Overview
**Project Snowflake** is a comprehensive project combining **DevOps** and **Data Engineering** principles to showcase the deployment and management of a Snowflake database using **LocalStack**. This project highlights skills in infrastructure as code (IaC), ETL development, and CI/CD pipeline automation.

The project demonstrates:
- Deploying Snowflake using Terraform with LocalStack for AWS service emulation.
- Designing efficient database schemas and implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
- Developing Python-based ETL pipelines for data ingestion and transformation.
- Automating workflows with GitHub Actions.

---

## Objectives
1. Set up a **mock AWS environment** using LocalStack for local development.
2. Use **Terraform** to provision Snowflake databases, schemas, roles, and users.
3. Design a robust **database schema** for handling analytical workflows.
4. Build and execute **ETL pipelines** for loading and transforming data.
5. Create a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate Terraform deployments and ETL jobs.
6. Document and validate all processes to ensure functionality and clarity.

## Project Features
- **LocalStack Integration**:
  Simulates AWS services locally, reducing reliance on cloud resources during development.

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  Snowflake resources are managed and provisioned using Terraform for scalability and reproducibility.

- **Database Schema Design**:
  Implements a logical schema design (e.g., star/snowflake schema) for optimized querying and analytics.

- **ETL Pipelines**:
  Python scripts handle data extraction, transformation, and loading into Snowflake, demonstrating practical data engineering workflows.

- **CI/CD Automation**:
  GitHub Actions automate the deployment of Terraform configurations and ETL scripts, ensuring efficient and error-free updates.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform.
- **LocalStack**: Local AWS cloud stack emulator.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for resource management.
- **Python**: Programming language for ETL pipeline development.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform for automating workflows.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker installed for LocalStack.
- Terraform installed for provisioning resources.
- Python 3.7+ for ETL development.
- Snowflake account credentials for Terraform configuration.

### Setup Steps
1. **Run LocalStack**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4571:4571 --name localstack localstack/localstack

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   
   
3. **Deploy Snowflake Resources Using Terraform**:

   ```bash

   terraform init
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   Run ETL Pipeline:
