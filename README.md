# Project Snowflake: Deploying Snowflake on Cloud

## Overview

**Project Snowflake** is a comprehensive project combining DevOps and Data Engineering principles to showcase the deployment and management of a Snowflake database directly on the cloud. This project highlights skills in infrastructure as code (IaC), ETL development, and CI/CD pipeline automation.

### The project demonstrates:
- Deploying and provisioning Snowflake resources using Terraform.
- Designing efficient database schemas and implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
- Developing Python-based ETL pipelines for data ingestion and transformation.
- Automating workflows with GitHub Actions.

## Objectives

1. Set up a Snowflake account for cloud-based data warehousing.
2. Use Terraform to provision Snowflake databases, schemas, roles, and users.
3. Design a robust database schema for handling analytical workflows.
4. Build and execute ETL pipelines for loading and transforming data.
5. Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate Terraform deployments and ETL jobs.
6. Document and validate all processes to ensure functionality and clarity.

## Project Features

### **Cloud-Based Snowflake Deployment**
Utilize a real Snowflake account for data warehousing and analytics, providing an authentic environment for hands-on learning.

### **Infrastructure as Code**
Manage and provision Snowflake resources using Terraform for scalability and reproducibility.

### **Database Schema Design**
Implement a logical schema design (e.g., star/snowflake schema) for optimized querying and analytics.

### **ETL Pipelines**
Python scripts handle data extraction, transformation, and loading into Snowflake, demonstrating practical data engineering workflows.

### **CI/CD Automation**
GitHub Actions automate the deployment of Terraform configurations and ETL scripts, ensuring efficient and error-free updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for resource management.
- **Python**: Programming language for ETL pipeline development.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform for automating workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account credentials for Terraform configuration.
- Terraform installed for provisioning resources.
- Python 3.7+ for ETL development.

---

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Snowflake Access
- Obtain Snowflake account details such as account name, username, and password.

### 2. Deploy Snowflake Resources Using Terraform
- Initialize Terraform and apply configurations to create databases, schemas, and roles in Snowflake:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform apply -auto-approve

### 3. Run ETL Pipeline

Use Python scripts to extract, transform, and load data into the Snowflake tables:

  ```bash
  python etl_script.py
